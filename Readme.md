Exploratory dfSummary
---------------------

This project aims to use summarytools on shiny and allowing a reactive
model with datatable filters. Itâ€™s also possible to download a pdf of
summarytools view function.

The idea is quite simple, upload the data and explore it by filtering
data and checking the result on the summary tab.

I find this helpful to have a quick look at the data and its attributes.

who delivered the best solution for a vast majority of r packages on
input files**

There is also a function to use it locally, this might be useful for
large datasets.
